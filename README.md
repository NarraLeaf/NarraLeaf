# NarraLeaf

A new definition of Visual Novel Engine.

## About

NarraLeaf is a visual novel engine that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is built on top of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/).

### Why NarraLeaf?

#### Easy to use
NarraLeaf provides a type-safe abstract API that makes it easy to implement character dialog, plot branching, data storing, and more while writing TypeScript scripts, making your creative process more focused and efficient.

#### Highly customizable
Based on React, you can customize UI styles and animations just like building a web page, or combine it with the Electron API to achieve richer interaction scenarios.

#### Cross-platform
You can generate Windows, macOS, and Linux installation packages with a single code, so you don't need to worry about the differences between platforms.

#### Abstraction and Flexibility
Compared to traditional engines, NarraLeaf gives you enough flexibility while avoiding tedious underlying configuration. You can still dive into the Electron environment and call or integrate system-level features.

#### Type-Safe
The entire engine is built in TypeScript and has well-designed type definitions for the core API, bringing you a more reliable development experience.
